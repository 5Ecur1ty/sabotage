This is sabotage, an experimental distribution based on musl libc and busybox.

Requirements:
- Only tested on x86_64, i386 shouldn't be hard to port.
- ~4G disk space
- root access
- usual GCC 4 toolchain
- a bootloader of your choice (extlinux is favored)
- lots of time and a fair bit of Linux knowledge

This system has been built on up-to-date Gentoo and Arch systems.

Build instructions:  Caveat emptor, this is all pre-alpha!
DO NOT RUN SCRIPTS YOU HAVE NOT READ.

% cp KEEP/config.stage0 config
% vi config
  $K  directory with patches
  $S  where sources are compiled (stage0: ~700MB, stage1: ~2.1GB)
  $R  root file system

% . ./config       # required!

% ./stage0         # build toolchain (~15min on a modern machine)
% ./enter-chroot   # enter $R chrooted, needs root password
# cd /tmp/src/sabotage   # absolute path required!
# ./stage1         # rebuild stuff, build kernel (~1h)
copy $R to a ext4 file-system
# extlinux -i $R/boot

If steps of the stage* scripts fail, you can comment out previous steps.
But you know that, since you read the scripts, didn't you?

The build is parallel-safe (MAKEOPTS=-jN), but all packages are build
sequentially.

The default root password is "sabotage".
